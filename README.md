# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Tachiyomi

Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android.

This is a fork from the original build for the purpose of adding features that I'd personally prefer to have, but probably wouldn't pass for others (or maybe it would, if I made a PR... someday =P).

Original source with features list and such can be found [here](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi/releases).

The rest of this readme will contain information specific to my own build. More to come soon(tm).
